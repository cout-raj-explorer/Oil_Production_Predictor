# Oil Production Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning models to predict **daily oil production (SmÂ³/day)** using real production parameters from the **Volve oil field dataset** (released by Equinor).

The goal is to demonstrate how regression techniques can be used in petroleum engineering to estimate oil output from well data.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Three trained models are included:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Polynomial Regression (degree 4)**
  - **Neural Network (ANN with 3 hidden layers)**
- Predictions based on production parameters such as temperature, pressure, choke size, and water volume.
- Pre-trained models are provided, so you can run predictions directly.
